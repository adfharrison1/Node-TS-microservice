### notes 
- i assume you're fine with the API key being present in a public repository!!! this would be bad if it was real. watch out for bored people trying to take your test API down!

- Ive chosen to use a containerized service that could be deployed (with the relevant infra additions) to your VPC or equivalent, to show that i know how to use Docker, no other reason.
